# Midori Next Generation v.10.0.2
This repository is for archiving purposes only, no copyright infringement intended. Midori Next Generation v.10.0.2 is an Electron-based browser for Windows, released sometime around 2022 prior Astian Inc.'s website redesign. It is a fork of [Wexond](https://github.com/wexond/browser-base). It comes with almost everything a browser ships with, I suppose. It works just fine on poltato pcs as well, just in case.

## Features
- Lightweight and minimal (it runs on my poltato pc, www)
- Built-in adblocker
- Simplistic user interface

## Cons
- Electron-based (might be a con for some)
- No longer updated (Astian shifted Midori to Gecko)
- No extension support
